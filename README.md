# My personal blog

This is my personal blog. It's built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [stlyed-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) ðŸš€.

### Run locally

To run locally, run `npm install` at the root. Next, run `npm start` which will do the following:

- Start a local web server
- Start a watcher for any `.js`, `.sass`, and `.html` files which will reload the browser automaticlly when triggered

### Build for production

To build the site for production, run `npm run build:site`. At this point, Gatsby will take control of creating the most optimized bundle and place the output in `public/` ready to be served.
